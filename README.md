# Work To Do


Work Todo is a simple Android application ðŸ“± which shows the work to perfrom in a list using Room Database and Recycler View
# About

- It simply loads the save work assigned to the database.
- It is offline capable(Locally sored using room)


# Built With ðŸ”¨
 - ```Kotlin``` - First class and official programming language for Android development.
 - ```Android Architecture Components``` - Here are the roles of every component:

    - ```Model``` â€” the data layer. Responsible for handling the business logic and communication with the network and database layers.
    - ```View ```â€” the UI layer. Displays the data and notifies the Presenter about user actions.
    - ```Presenter``` â€” retrieves the data from the Model, applies the UI logic and manages the state of the View, decides what to display and reacts to user input notifications from the View.
    
    Since the View and the Presenter work closely together, they need to have a reference to one another. To make the Presenter unit testable with JUnit, the View is abstracted and an interface for it used. The relationship between the Presenter and its corresponding View is defined in a ```Contract``` interface class, making the code more readable and the connection between the two easier to understand.
- ```Recycler view``` - RecyclerView is a ViewGroup added to the android studio as a successor of the GridView and ListView. It is an improvement on both of them and can be found in the latest v-7 support packages.
- ```Data class``` - We frequently create classes whose main purpose is to hold data. In such a class some standard functionality and utility functions are often mechanically derivable from the data. In Kotlin, this is called a data class and is marked as data : data class User(val name: String, val age: Int)
- ```Room``` -    The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. Room is part of the Android Architecture Components presented in the Google I/O 2016. It is not an ORM, it is a whole library that allows us to create and manipulate SQLite databases easier, by using annotations we can define our databases, its tables and operations; Room will automatically translate these annotations into SQLite instructions/queries to perform the correspondent operations into the DB engine.
